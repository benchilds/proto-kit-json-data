# Making dynamic GOV.UK protoypes

This repo is intended to support an article about how to use JSON data in the GOV.UK Prototype Kit to make more dynamic prototypes.  
Read the article (on Medium)

## Overview

Many of the products that digital designers (Interaction, UX, UI) work on are dynamic products e.g. the content and features experienced by the the end-user are not demonstrable by the designer.  
TODO Finish this after writing the Medium article!!!

## About this code

* This repo contains a fully installable, customised version of the GOV.UK Prototype Kit that demonstrates the methods described for using JSON data to make dynamic prototypes.
* The code is meant for demonstration and exploration purposes only and is **not** intended to be a GOV.UK Prototype Kit starter project.
* In an attempt to be as 'maintenance free' as possible, wherever possible dependent code is included rather than using sub-repositories or packages (or any smarter methods that would probably be preferable in an ongoing codebase).
* To facilitate easy integration into other projects, the default Protoype Kit has been customised as little as possible besides the main focus of handling JSON data.
* Whilst not conclusive, the extent of customisations include:
    - JSON data handling logic has been added to the `routes.js` file.
    - TODO Add other customisation notes here.
